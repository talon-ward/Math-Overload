The <i>sequence space</i> $s$ is another example of a metric space. It consists of the set of all sequences of complex numbers together with the metric<br /><br />
<center>$d(x, y) = \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^j} \frac{|x_j - y_j|}{1 + |x_j - y_j|}$</center><br />
where $x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots)$ and $y = (y_1, y_2, \ldots)$. Verification that $s$ is a metric space is left as an exercise.<br /><br />

The space $B(A)$ is also an example of a metric space. It consists of the set of all bounded, real-valued functions on a set $A$ together with the metric $d(x, y) = \mathrm{sup}_{t \in A} |x(t) - y(t)|$. Verification that $B(A)$ is a metric space is also left as an exercise.<br /><br />

Let $l^p$, $p \geq 1$, be the set of all (real or complex) sequences $(x_i)$ such that<br /><br />
<center>$\displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^\infty |x_j|^p$</center><br />
converges. Then, $l^p$ is a metric space with metric defined by<br /><br />
<center>$d(x, y) = \left( \displaystyle \sum_{j=1}^\infty |x_j - y_j|^p \right)^{1/p}</center><br />
In the case that $p = 2$, $l^p$ is the <i>Hilbert sequence space</i>. To prove that $l^p$ is a metric space, we must first derive a couple inequalities.<br /><br />

Let $p > 1$ and choose $q$ such that $1/p + 1/q = 1$. Then $p$ and $q$ are called <i>conjugate exponents</i>.<br /><br />

<i>Proposition: If $\alpha, \beta$ are positive real numbers, then $\alpha \beta \leq \alpha^p/p + \beta^q/q$, where $p, q$ are conjugate exponents.</i><br /><br /> Proof. Let $p, q$ be conjugate exponents. Then, $p + q = pq$, so that $(p - 1)(q - 1) = 1$, and we have $q - 1 = 1/(p - 1)$. Let $f(x) = x^{p-1}$. Then $f^{-1}(x) = x^{q-1}$. Since inversion is reflection about the line $f(x) = x$, and $f(x)$ and $f^{-1}(x)$ are increasing, the area of the rectangle $\alpha \beta$ is less than the sum of the integrals $\int_0^\alpha x^{p-1} \, dx$ and $\int_0^\beta x^{q-1} \, dq$. Thus,<br /><br />
<center>$\alpha \beta \leq \displaystyle \int_0^\alpha x^{p - 1} \, dx + \displaystyle \int_0^\beta x^{q-1} \, dx = \displaystyle \frac{\alpha^p}{p} + \frac{\beta^q}{q}$</center><br /><br />
