For $kd$, we must have $k \neq 0$, so that $d(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$. Since a distance function must be nonnegative, we must have $k > 0$. If $k > 0$, then $k d(x, y) = k d(y, x)$ if and only if $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$, so the second condition of a metric imposes no further restriction on $k$. Finally, if $d(x, y) \leq d(x, z) + d(z, y)$, then $k d(x, y) \leq k d(x, z) + k d(z, y)$, for all $k > 0$, so that the third condition on a metric also places no further restriction. Therefore, if $d$ is a metric on any set $X$ of order greater than one, then $kd$ is a metric for all $k > 0$ and not a metric for all $k \leq 0$. If $X$ is of order one, then $k$ can be any real number (since the metric on $X$ is the zero function).<br /><br />

For $k + d$, we have $d(x, x) = 0$, and we must have $k + d(x, x) = 0$, so that $k = 0$.
