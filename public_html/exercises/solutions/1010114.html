We have slightly changed the order of the terms in the triangle inequality. We must show that the two given conditions imply that $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$. If we let $z = y$, then we have<br /><br />

<center>$d(x, y) \leq d(y, x) + d(y, y) = d(y, x)$</center><br />

If we let $z = x$ and switch $x$ and $y$, we have<br /><br />

<center>$d(y, x) \leq d(x, y) + d(x, x) = d(x, y)$</center><br />

Therefore, $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$, and the two given conditions are an equivalent defintion of a metric.
