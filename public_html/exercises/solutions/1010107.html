Let $x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots)$ and $y = (y_1, y_2, \ldots)$ be two elements of $A$. Then, each $x_i$ and $y_i$ is either $0$ or $1$, so that $|x_i - y_i|$ is either $0$ or $1$. Thus, either $x = y$ and $d(x, y) = 0$, or $x \neq y$ and $d(x, y) = 1$. That is, the induced metric on $A$ is the discrete metric.
