The generalized triangle inequality states that<br /><br />

<center>$d(x_1, x_n) \leq d(x_1, x_2) + d(x_2, x_3) + \cdots + d(x_{n-1}, x_n)$</center><br />

for each $x_i \in X$. From this, we have<br /><br />

<center>$d(x, y) \leq d(x, z) + d(z, w) + d(w, y)$</center><br />

which implies that<br /><br />

<center>$d(x, y) - d(z, w) \leq d(x, z) + d(y, w)$</center><br />

By switching the order of $w$, $x$, $y$, and $z$, we get<br /><br />

<center>$d(z, w) \leq d(z, x) + d(x, y) + d(y, w)$</center><br />

which implies that<br /><br />

<center>$-(d(x, y) - d(z, w)) \leq d(x, z) + d(y, w)$</center><br />

From both these equations, we conclude that<br /><br />

<center>$|d(x, y) - d(z, w)| \leq d(x, z) + d(y, w)$</center><br />
