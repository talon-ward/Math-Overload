Let $X = \{0, 1\}$ and $A = X \times X \times X$; that is, $A$ is the set of all ordered triples of zeros and ones. Show that $d(x, y) = \lVert x - y \rVert_0$, where $\lVert a \rVert_0$ is the number of nonzero components of $a \in A$, is a metric on $A$. This metric is called the <i>Hamming distance</i>.
