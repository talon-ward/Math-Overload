   <div class="about-text">Math Overload is a free resource for advanced mathematics self-instruction.</div>
   <div class="about-text"><b>IMPORTANT!</b> While this site is under construction (always), it is strongly recommended that you re-save your course selection each study session. Currently, saving your course initiates valuable pre-processing that would otherwise leave you unable to access newly entered material.</div>
   <div class="about-section">Quick Start</div>
   <div class="about-text">
    To get started quickly, perform the following steps:
    <ul>
     <li />Click on the <i>courses</i> link.
     <li />Select the checkbox(es) for the course(s) you wish to study.
     <li />Click the <i>save</i> button.
     <li />Profit.<div class="about-tip">Note: Please see the below <i>study</i> section to fully utilize the site.</div>
    </ul>
   </div>
   <div class="about-section">Courses</div>
   <div class="about-text">
    The courses section allows you select which subjects you are studying. New material is restricted to content that is part of at least one of your current course selections. If you stop studying a course, however, previously presented material from that course will continue to be reinforced. This is working as intended.
   </div>
   <div class="about-section">Progress</div>
   <div class="about-text">
    The progress section provides a visual representation of the course material you have completed. It presents you a level based on how much you have studied and a title based on your level. It's completely useless; therefore, it's completely incomplete.
   </div>
   <div class="about-section">Study</div>
   <div class="about-text">
    The study section is where one learns and reinforces the relevant definitions, propositions, lemmas, theorems, etc. for the courses. It is imperative that this section be used appropriately to properly benefit from this site.
    <ul>
     <li />Try to answer a question before you view the options.<div class="about-tip">When a question is presented, the answer options will be hidden, so you can think of the correct answer without being shown the options. Click "show options" when you are ready to answer.</div><br />
     <li />Select the correct submit button.<div class="about-tip">If you do not know the correct answer, select "I don't know." If you remembered the correct answer only after viewing the options or if you are not completely certain your answer is correct, select "I had to peek." If you know you have the answer, and you knew the answer before seeing the options, choose "I got this!" Even if you are going to select "I don't know," you should enter your best guess.</div><br />
     <li />Think about the questions.<div class="about-tip">When answering questions in this manner, it can be easy to become conditioned by 'quick outs' instead of fully reviewing the material. For instance, the first few words of the question, even if they would be meaningless out of context, could become associated with the correct answer. One method used to combat this is having multiple questions for the same topic. However, ultimately, it is up to the studying individual to recognize if he or she is falling into this habit and to make a conscious effort to consider the question as a whole.</div><br />
     <li />Write down the answer.<div class="about-tip">Writing the answer on paper will greatly improve reinforcement and ensure that you are actually thinking about the answer instead of thinking about thinking about the answer. Speaking the answer aloud will also help. Ideally, both should be done.</div><br />
     <li />Make additional associations as necessary.<div class="about-tip">Studying only requires you to select the best multiple choice option. For best results, one can take this a step further. For instance, when asked to recall a proposition, you may wish to recall the proof of that proposition. Even simply remembering the "trick" that leads to the proof can increase the value of the question dramatically.</div>
    </ul>
    This site helps automate and expedite the learning process. However, this service is still a self-study tool, and, ultimately, you are the one who is studying. This service can help, but it can't learn for you.
   </div>
   <div class="about-section">Notes</div>
   <div class="about-text">
    The notes section provides direct links to the presentation material that introduces each new topic. It is included for reference and completion but is not necessary for normal site use.
   </div>
   <div class="about-section">Exercises</div>
   <div class="about-text">
    The exercises section is similar to the study section in that you are presented questions to answer. However, the exercises section asks you to use the material you memorized from the study section in order to answer longer questions that require more thought.<br /><br />You are not supposed to memorize exercises, but there is valuable information in their solutions that should not be forgotten. Thus, exercises will be repeated -- though at longer intervals than the study material -- based on how they are graded.<br /><br />As with studied material, try your best to answer the question before showing the solution. Because exercises take longer and their solutions may not be immediately apparent, you are able to keep multiple exercises opened at once. It is strongly recommended that the solutions are viewed <i>only</i> to check your own answer and that exercises be kept open with their solution not viewed until you have produced an answer.<br /><br />The grades are A, B, C, D, and F. The grade you assign an exercise will affect the duration until you see that exercise again -- A being the longest and F being the shortest. As with all other aspects of this self-study course, accurate self-reporting provides the best benefit.
